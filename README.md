Overview
--------
ChoiceView is a Communications-as-a-Service (CAAS) platform that allows visual information
to be sent from a contact center agent or IVR to mobile users equipped with the ChoiceView app.

The ChoiceView IVR Web API is a REST-based service that provides IVR systems and telephony services
access to ChoiceView features.

This repository contains sample source code for an enhanced ChoiceView-enabled visual IVR. This
visual IVR can send visual menus to the caller, receive menu selections back from the caller, receive
data entered by the caller and provide visual responses to the caller, in addition to providing
standard voice prompts and DTMF detection.

The sample visual IVR is implemented using the Tropo Cloud API along with the ChoiceView Web API.
Tropo is a massively scalable developer platform that makes it simple to quickly and easily build phone,
SMS and Instant Messaging applications - or applications that handle all three - using the web technologies
you already know and Tropo's powerful cloud API.  You can get more information about Tropo at
http://www.tropo.com.
