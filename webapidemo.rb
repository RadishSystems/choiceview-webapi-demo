#
# ChoiceView is a Communications-as-a-Service (CAAS) platform that allows visual information
# to be sent from a contact center agent or IVR to mobile users equipped with the ChoiceView app.  
#
# Below is sample source code for an IVR script that enhances an existing IVR to become a
# ChoiceView-enabled visual IVR.  The resulting visual IVR can send visual menus to the caller,
# receive menu selections back from the caller, receive data entered by the caller and provide
# visual responses to the caller, in addition to providing standard voice prompts and DTMF.
#
# The sample script below illustrates use of ChoiceView for implementing a simple visual IVR demo.
# It's intended that the concepts and code provided herein can be used to create production visual
# IVR scripts.
#
# The ChoiceView app is available for free at the Apple App Store and Android Market.  Once it's
# installed on your mobile device, you can try the demo by calling 720-515-6994.

# Tropo script showing how to use the ChoiceView IVR REST API to:
#
# 1. connect to a ChoiceView server
# 2. register to receive notifications when the connection state changes
# 3. send web pages to the client
# 4. receive control notifications from the client when the user presses a button on the web page
#
# How to run this script:
# Create a Tropo account, upload this script to the hosting area,
# then add a new scripting application that loads this script.
#
# The web page referred to by the script is at
# http://cvnet2.radishsystems.com/choiceview/ivr/api_button_demo.html
# View the source of this page to see how the button links are coded.

# or support@radishsystems.com or darryl@radishsystems.com to get the information needed
# to access the ChoiceView REST API.
